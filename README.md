# Thailand General Election Map 2019
This repository contains the code that I used to compile the data to build an [interactive map](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/fdcdec989c2c4c97a38df2369bf1194c/) in ArcGis. The goal is to visualize election results, gauge electoral performance by parties, examine patterns in voter turnout and identify geographic clustering of votes and partisanship.

Data Source: [Election Commission of Thailand](https://www.ect.go.th/ect_th/ewt_dl_link.php?nid=8448)
